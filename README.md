# Password-Strength-Evaluation-
Understanding what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

# üõ°Ô∏è Task 6 ‚Äì Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective
To understand what makes a password strong, test different types of passwords using an online password strength checker (e.g., [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)), and evaluate their effectiveness against common password attacks.

| Password             | Score | Feedback                          |
|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| weak123              | 18%   | Too short, common, predictable    |
| StrongPass2025       | 56%   | Better, but missing symbols       |
| Str0ng!Passw0rd#25   | 92%   | Strong ‚Äì good mix of characters   |
| M^9p$!kT2&xR@7z      | 100%  | Excellent ‚Äì random, long, complex |

## Analysis
- Weak passwords are short and predictable, making them vulnerable to **dictionary** and **brute-force attacks**.  
- Medium-strength passwords are better but still guessable with **hybrid attacks** (words + numbers).  
- Strong passwords with symbols and length are much harder to crack.  
- Completely random complex passwords are the strongest, but harder to remember without a password manager.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Use at least **12‚Äì16 characters**.  
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.  
3. Avoid personal details (name, DOB, pet names).  
4. Don‚Äôt use dictionary words or common patterns like `123456`, `qwerty`, `password`.

6. Use a **passphrase** for memorability (e.g., *Blue!TigerRuns@9AM*).  
7. Store complex passwords securely with a **password manager**.  
8. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** ‚Üí Tries every possible combination. Long, complex passwords take much longer to crack.  
- **Dictionary Attack** ‚Üí Uses common word lists. Adding symbols/numbers helps resist.  
- **Hybrid Attack** ‚Üí Combines dictionary + brute force (e.g., `password123!`).  
- **Phishing / Social Engineering** ‚Üí Tricks users into revealing their password. Awareness is key here.

## Conclusion
Password complexity directly impacts security. Short and predictable passwords are easily cracked, while long, random, and mixed-character passwords provide significantly higher protection.  
**Best approach:** use unique, complex passwords with MFA support to ensure maximum account safety.
